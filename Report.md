Discussion: 
The data we collected is from an off campus apartment. This means there are many more devices that were scanned in the process.
We first had trouble in the beginning stages because we didn't know that we had to close out of the python interpreter.
We also had to use hotspot in the lab because we were unable to connect to any of the BU wifis.
We also didn't know how to ensure that the raspberry pi was connected to our laptops, until we found a command that secures the connection. (ping raspberrypi.local)
